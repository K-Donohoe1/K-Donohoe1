### Featured Project: LEC 2026 Predictive Engine

#### 🏆 [LEC-2026-Prediction](https://github.com/K-Donohoe1/LEC-2026-Prediction)
*A Machine Learning application that predicts match outcomes for the 2026 League of Legends EMEA Championship.*

**The Engineering Challenge:**
I needed to predict the performance of a newly formed league structure (including ERL teams like *Los Ratones*) using historical data that didn't perfectly map to the new 2026 format.

**Key Technical Implementations:**
* **Data Pipeline:** Aggregated and cleaned 4 years of professional match data (2022-2025) from Oracle's Elixir.
* **Feature Engineering:** Created a custom "Context-Aware Scoring" system to normalize stats between Tier 1 (LEC) and Tier 2 (ERL) leagues, preventing inflated stats from lower leagues skewing predictions.
* **Legacy Logic:** Built specific algorithmic overrides to handle outlier cases (e.g., "Smurf Detection" for ex-pro rosters) where raw stats don't tell the full story.
* **Model:** Implemented Logistic Regression to calculate win probabilities based on Gold, XP, Damage, and Vision differentials.
